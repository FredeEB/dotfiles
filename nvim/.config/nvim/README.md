# My neovim config

Lua/Packer based neovim config, that is made to be as little in the way of my daily workflow as possible.

`lua/config` contains configuration of all the packages in coneceptually grouped files.
`lua/functions` contains arbitrary helper functions. At the time of writing, only a few shortcuts to keybinds
