# All my relevant dotfiles
These are the files I download and run everytime I reinstall any linux based system. These have only been tested recently on arch but *shouldn't* care about the distro. I also use these on MacOS at my workplace, and that works just fine too.

It's based on:

- bash
- tmux
- alacritty
- polybar
- others...

and my very basic (ripoff of wiki) [penrose client](https://github.com/fredeeb/penrose)

The abovementioned packages need to be installed from wherever you install your packages, as they of course rely on some executables.

Outside of these files, there's my [neovim config](https://github.com/fredeeb/nvim), which is also included under `nvim/.config/nvim` as a submodule.

There's another submodule under `tmux/.config/tmux/tpm` which is the [Tmux Package Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) and it's awesome.

I used to use emacs, and my config for that is [here](https://github.com/fredeeb/.emacs.d), this has likely seen its last commits though.

Use them at your own risk. I don't stand responsible for anything you break with my files.
