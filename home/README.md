# All my relevant dotfiles
These are the files I download and run everytime I reinstall any linux based system. These have been tested recently on arch, ubuntu and macos and are pretty agnostic.

It's based on:

- bash
- urxvt
- nvim
- polybar
- others...

I used to use emacs, and my config for that is [here](https://github.com/fredeeb/.emacs.d), this has likely seen its last commits though.
