# All my relevant dotfiles
These are the files I download and run everytime I reinstall any linux based system. These have only been tested on linux and debian but *shouldn't* care about the distro. I also use these on MacOS at my workplace, and that works just fine too.

It's based on:

- zsh
- alacritty
- polybar
- picom

and my fork of [dwm](https://github.com/fredeeb/dwm)

The abovementioned packages need to be installed from wherever you install your packages, and then [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) will take care of all the plugins used in the terminal, and everything will be lovely.

Outside of these files, there's my [neovim config](https://github.com/fredeeb/nvim). I used to use emacs, and my config for that is [here](https://github.com/fredeeb/.emacs.d), this has likely seen its last commits though

Use them at your own risk. I don't stand responsible for anything you break with my files.
