* All my relevant dotfiles
These are the files I download and run everytime I reinstall any linux based system. These have only been tested on linux and debian but *shouldn't* care about the distro.

It's based on:

- zsh
- alacritty
- polybar
- picom

and my fork of [[https://github.com/fredeeb/dwm][dwm]]

The abovementioned packages need to be installed from wherever you install your packages, and then [[https://github.com/zplug/zplug][zplug]] will take care of all the plugins used in the terminal, and everything will be lovely.

Use them at your own risk. I don't stand responsible for anything you break with my files.
